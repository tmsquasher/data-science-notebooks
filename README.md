data-science-notebooks
======================

A collection of my ipython notebooks as I attempt to learn more about machine learning, statistics, and data science in general.

Some of the code here is copied from other places (e.g., scikit-learn.com); other bits have been built from scratch so I can better understand the fundamental processes going on. Above all, the idea is to help visualize concepts and to provide a clearer and more intuitive understanding of what's going on in these various algorithms.
