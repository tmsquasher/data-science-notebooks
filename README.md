data-science-notebooks
======================

A collection of my IPython Notebooks as I try to learn more about machine learning, statistics, and data science in general.

Some of the code here is copied from other places (e.g., scikit-learn.org); some has been tweaked for emphasis/explanatory purposes; and other bits have been built from scratch to better understand the fundamental processes going on. Above all, the idea is to help visualize, clarify, and intuit the major ideas behind these concepts. Sometimes re-inventing the wheel is the best way to learn!

On the todo list...
- Bootstrap
- HMMs
- MCMC
- Regularization
- SVM Kernel Functions
- Decision Trees
